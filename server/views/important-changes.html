                        <h2 class="heading-medium">4. Important changes to fishing licences</h2>
<p>From 1 April 2017, the fishing licence service is introducing several changes. </p>
<h3 class="heading-small">Free junior licences</h3>
<p>If you're between 12 and 16, you'll no longer need to pay for your licence. However, you still need to get a licence, so you will have to go through the online process of getting it.</p>
                        <h3 class="heading-small">12-month licences available at any time of the year</h3>
                        <p>12-month licences will now be valid for a full year from their start date. You'll be able to purchase them at any time during the year.</p>
                        <h3 class="heading-small">Licence upgrades</h3>
                        <p>You'll be able to upgrade your 1-day or 8-day licence to a 12-month licence. When you make this upgrade, your fee will be discounted from the 12-month licence price. You'll have 14 days from the date and time of expiry to complete
                            this upgrade.</p>
                        <h3 class="heading-small">3-rod licences for trout and coarse fish</h3>
                        <p>You'll be able to buy one licence that allows you to fish with 3 rods.</p>
                        <h3 class="heading-small">1-day and 8-day licence start times</h3>
                        <p>1-day and 8-day licences will only become valid 30 minutes after payment.</p>
